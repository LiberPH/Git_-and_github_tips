# Git_-and_github_tips
My learning path to git and github

 This is based in the github repository of Carlos called (git_notes)[https://github.com/CarlosEspondaNieto/QA/blob/master/git_notes.md].

# Basic

**add** Before commiting, it is important to add a new file, or its changes to a new repository. 

# Branches

If you have more than one working project, you need to specify where are you creating a new branch both, when you create it, and when you upload it.
Example:

```
git branch upstream/testing_nose
git add ./test_AnalyticMetrics.py 
 git commit -m upstream/testing_nose

```
